# nandobot-go

Nandobot-GO is a Golang interpretation of my previous project Nandobot.

Instead of being a Discord bot, it uses Discord Webhooks to send the discord messages.

Also new:
- Generates an image of the player's items stitched together and uploads it to Imgur
- Has an API for adding new players and getting the last match info
- Stores all matches on db
